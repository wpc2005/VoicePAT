    Output: All time values default to nanoseconds
        Utilization : Percent of time when queue was not empty
        Instances : Number of events
        Avg : Average event duration
        Med : Median event duration
        Min : Minimum event duration
        Max : Maximum event duration
        StdDev : Standard deviation of event durations
        Name : Event name
        Q Type : Queue type ID
        Q Name : Queue type name
        PID : Process ID associated with event
        GPU ID : GPU index
        Context : WDDM context of queue
        Engine : Engine type ID
        Node Ord : WDDM node ordinal ID

    This report provides a summary of the WDDM queue utilization.  The
    utilization is calculated by comparing the amount of time when the queue had
    one or more active events to total duration, as defined by the minimum and
    maximum event time for a given Process ID (regardless of the queue context).
