    Output: All time values default to nanoseconds
        Time : Percentage of "Total Time"
        Total Time : Total time used by all instances of this range
        Instances: Number of instances of this range
        Avg : Average execution time of this range
        Med : Median execution time of this range
        Min : Smallest execution time of this range
        Max : Largest execution time of this range
        StdDev : Standard deviation of execution time of this range
        Range : Name of the range

    This report provides a summary of DX12 PIX GPU command list debug markers,
    and their execution times. Note that the "Time" column
    is calculated using a summation of the "Total Time" column, and represents
    that range's percent of the execution time of the ranges listed, and not a
    percentage of the application wall or CPU execution time.
